# BIbliophile-Companion

Bibliophile Companion is a learning companion for slow learners and lazy  people so they can learn the concepts faster. This is needed to  motivate slow learners as they struggle to find the relevant answers efficiently and thus either demotivate themselves or their laziness starts to kick in. This can be done by having a QnA system that processes the selected topic in backend with the help of NLP and gives appropriate answers  be it  subjective or objective, also this can further be improved by generating a ppt about the same topic with all the key points and thus helping in revision and then end with a quiz as well so that one can evaluate how much he has understood the topic.
